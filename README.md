This project involves in making an online multiplayer game called, “FOR
BATTLE!!”. This online multiplayer game is about players being able to battle with other
players, by attacking them or defending against them, using the characters they own in their
collection, to compete for the battle points in which they can earn after winning a battle. This
battle point is crucial for players as it determines which player is the strongest and the best
among all players. Besides, players can choose the character of their choice to fight for them
against other player’s character.
Furthermore, characters can be obtained by players through the purchase of chests using
their in-game money which is earned through battles, where each chest contains different
characters that that have unique characteristics and skills. Players are also able to collect all
available characters to complete their collection. If they were to obtain the same character from
any of the previous purchases, the character itself will receive an enhancement which will boost
the stats of the character itself, making it stronger for the next upcoming battle.
This game also awards players with an achievement if the players were to meet a certain
requirement while using the game. This will give a sense of accomplishment to the players and
also the drive to keep playing to achieve all the available achievements.
